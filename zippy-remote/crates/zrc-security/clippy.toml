# Clippy configuration for zrc-security
# Requirements: 13.3
#
# Note: Clippy configuration is typically done via code attributes or workspace config.
# This file documents recommended linting settings.
#
# To enable security-focused linting, add to Cargo.toml or use attributes:
#
# [lints.clippy]
# unwrap_used = "warn"
# expect_used = "warn"
# panic = "warn"
# integer_arithmetic = "warn"
# cast_possible_truncation = "warn"
# indexing_slicing = "warn"
#
# Or run: cargo clippy -p zrc-security -- -W clippy::unwrap_used -W clippy::expect_used
